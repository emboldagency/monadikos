A collection of Tailwind Blocks for Sage 11 based themes. Requires Advanced Custom Fields PRO plugin to be enabled and activated.

== Description ==

This plugin utilizes the acf-composer and acf-builder packages and allows us to include our own default
Block and Field classes in the plugin files to jumpstart theme development.

If for some reason you need to tweak or modify what comes with the plugin you can copy the file into your theme and tweak it.
Need the Statistics block to do something slightly different? Copy its app/Blocks/Statistics.php from the plugin to your theme and
the theme files take priority. You can do this with the Padding field, or any views as well.

Please view the full README.md on GitHub.
