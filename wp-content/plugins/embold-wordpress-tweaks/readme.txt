# Tweaks and Changes to WordPress

There are common changes we normally have to make in every generic WordPress website.

1. Allow SVG uploads in the admin panel.
2. Local only: Defer and async various Gutenberg scripts to avoid Coders 502 errors.
3. Local only: Disable all "wp_mail" functions so Mailgun can't randomly mass email users. This will also break the test
email sent out from local.
4. Disable XML-RPC for security reasons.
5. Remove line breaks from img tags if litespeed cache plugin is active.
6. Allow searching for posts/pages by slug in the admin panel using the prefix 'slug:' before the search term.
7. Adds a slug column to the posts/pages tables in the admin panel.
8. Disables plugin, theme, and file management unless email is our set email. Additional emails can be set in the wp-config.
9. Changes the admin login URL to the value of 'EMBOLD_ADMIN_URL', if set.

## To send email on staging/local

Define the 'DISABLE_MAIL' as false in your wp-config.php

`define('DISABLE_MAIL', true);`

## Requirements

Define the 'WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE' as 'development', 'staging', or 'production' in the corresponding wp-config.php

`define('WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'development');`
